### Description

In this meetup I'll show how you can use GitHub to manage your research.

### Tentative outline

* Create a research organization to manage multiple projects.
* Create an organization-wide webpage.
* Create private and public projects (fold
ers) to store almost anything.
* Create a project-specific webpage.
* Add colleagues to your organization and organize them in teams to work on specific projects.
* Track conversations for each project.
* Manage notifications.
* Clone and connect a GitHub project with RStudio.

### Resources

* [Request unlimited free private repos](https://github.com/forestgeo/learn/issues/22).
